    "quienesSomos": "SIXTAGE was founded in 2023. It emerged from the enthusiasm, commitment, and need of a group of Full Stack Web Development students.\nAn idea born from a common passion: the taste and love for fashion.\nWe rescue unique garments that should not die, garments that still have many stories to live, despite surviving the passage of time and history.\nWe select accessories and garments with great care and detail. Each of them represents us and makes us feel authentic and special.\nOur greatest desire is to find exclusive and irreplaceable products for all of you and to know that by acquiring any of them, you are contributing to the deepest sense of sustainability and care for the only medium we cannot replace.",
